# Principles
- :cyclone: Take into account the organizational system as a whole and the value streams.
- :loop: Amplify 'feedback loops'.
- :zap: Experiment and learn continuously. 
- :high_brightness: Decentralize decisions. 
  - When it is necessary to decide on more than one person, restrict to a few people representing the impacted scopes. 
  - People who participate in the decisions are also impacted by the decisions.
   - Before making decisions, consider information from impacted people who do not participate in decisions.
   - After making decisions, gather reactions from the impacted people who did not participate in the decisions.
- :loudspeaker: Make information available and understandable to all people who need or can benefit from that information.
   - Work in public, making the progress of projects visible for consultation at any time.
- :thumbsup: Everything is allowed as long as it is not explicitly forbidden.

# Organizational structure
The organizational structure is defined by contornos. The people in the organization work guided by these contornos, a hierarchy of specificity, not of people. 

The system starts with the maxim that _"everything is allowed as long as it is not explicitly forbidden"_ in some [agreement](#agreements) containing restriction or defined as [resources o exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) of some contorno instead of the common inverse in many organizations that _"everything is forbidden as long as it is explicitly allowed"_. 

# Contornos
A contorno is a scope delimited by reason for existence, responsibilities, resources of exclusive control, and proper agreements.
One person can be on several contornos, and one contorno can contain several people.

The definition of Contornos avoids deciding all the time what needs to be done and who will do something.

Each contorno governs its own structure, which can be changed by the contorno guardian or by integrative decision depending on the context.

## How to split contornos?

### ✂️ Division of contornos
1. by **[Value Flow]**:
   - **intent**(*) of the audience that a contorno serves
   - **person's journey stage** when carrying out an intention(*)
   - **strategy of a larger contorno**
     - examples: "Personalized content per member"; "Members connected to at least one other member on the platform"; "Products found on first search attempt"; etc)
   - **product** or **service**  
   - **initiative**
2. by **[Market]**:
   - sides or **actors of a marketplace**: supply, demand, providers, contractors, Business to Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), Business to Business to Consumer (B2B2C), Business to Government (B2G), Consumer to Consumer (C2C) ou Direct to Consumer (D2C).
   - **geographical areas**
3. by **[Specialty]**:
   - **work** specialties
   - expertise in **modules** of the organization's technological services
4. by thematic **[Forum]**:
   - a contorno that gathers people around the same theme, idea, technique or skill.

_(*) Intent can be understood as a Job To Be Done, purpose in Fit For Purpose, a "tower" or "mental space" from Indi Young's Mental Model diagram, etc._
If interested, consult materials such as [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology-ebook/dp/B07NSF94PC), [Fit For Purpose](https://www. amazon.com/Fit-Purpose-Businesses-Satisfy-Customers/dp/0985305118) and [Jobs To Be Done](https://medium.com/tentaculus/jobs-to-be-done-parte-1-42bfdf4875c8) ._

### 🚧 Types of contornos:
   - **Support**: work to allow and enhance the work of other contornos of the organization or an interface between a solution from external providers with the organization.
   - **Development**: work for the organization's target audience.

### ⌚ Duration of contornos:
1. **Stable**: they have no determined expiration and lasts as long as it makes sense.
2. **Temporary**: they are born with an already determined expiration, focusing on some occasional context. It can be expired based on a date or the completion of a project.

### Combinations
It is possible to make combinations of all these above ways.

## Example of a structure of contornos 
**Quick Examples:**
- **stable** contorno of **development** split by **marketplace actors** with **stable** internal contorno by **intention** split by **marketplace actor**.
- **stable** contorno of **development** split by **strategies** with **stable** internal contorno of **support**.
- **stable** contorno of **development** split by **intention** with **temporary** internal contorno split by **initiative**.

Any pre-made model on the design of teams is flawed by nature precisely because it does not reflect or adapt to reality. However, some can be useful to inspire and initiate experiments. There is no universal recipe.

## How to map current scopes of the organization that reflect possible contornos?

If you want to find out which are the networks and scopes that already work in the organization, even if informally, here are some options:
- ["Organizational Network Analysis"](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/articles/organizational-network-analysis.html) and look at the type of connections that currently exist.
- Mapping [process and value stream](references#refer%C3%AAnces-about-process-mapping) of the larger contorno in relation to the organization's reason for existing.
- Mapping of activities that people currently perform and [convert to responsibilities](questions#how-to-define-responsibilities-of-a-outline). After that, define the contornos and all their attributes.

## When to create new contornos?

Create contornos when:
- noticing some recurring patterns that would be dealt with more effectively if they were in charge of a specific contorno;
- identify issues that need ongoing care;
- you want to execute and complete a project that temporarily requires joint work apart from an existing contorno.

Examples demonstrating contexts for creating contours in case of recurring patterns:
- recurrently the contour you participate needs to perform data analysis in a more advanced way. For a while the participants were trying to help each other, each hour doing the task and learning what was needed. It was not clear who had this responsibility. Due to this recurrence, someone registered a [driver](#drivers) for the contour with a proposal to create an internal "data analysis" contour, making it explicit what was expected. Then, they made a proposal for the allocation of a person as guardian of this contour. From then on, they no longer had to decide who would do this type of work and what responsibilities were expected, as the outline already made it clear.
- a "Tech" contour has the responsibility to take care of the infrastructure and deployment process of some systems that the contour develops. However, this started to generate conflicts and doubts about which participants would have to have the skills, knowledge and attention for this. So, one participant created a [driver](#drivers) with a proposal to create an internal contour of "Platform" delegating the "deploy process" as exclusive control for this new contour and also the responsibilities of taking care of the infrastructure and the process . Then they allocated one person as [guardian](#guardi%c3%a3-of-contour) and another with [agent](#agent-of-contour).

**Recommendations**:
- delimit new contornos from the demands of the public, internal or external.
- minimize the creation of contornos that depend on recurring, expected and necessary deliveries (_handover_ or _handoff_) of other contornos that are not within the same external contorno. Favor that participants of the contornos that have dependence can have a close context in common - an external contour, favoring them to participate in meetings, decisions and treatment of [drivers](#drivers) together.
  - if a dependency between contornos that are on different external contornos is desired or necessary, it is recommended to create a structural role of [representative](apps#structural-representative-role) so that those contornos have some link.
 

## How to adapt or remove a contorno?
Anytime someone perceives that a contorno needs, or is desirable, to be adapted, whatever the attribute, or that it no longer has a reason to exist, a proposal can be made to carry out this alteration or removal of the contorno.

To remove a contorno, an integrative decision by the external contorno is necessary, being able to decide which contornos internal to the contorno being deleted they want to bring to the contorno that is making the decision.

To adapt the contorno, it is necessary to identify which [attribute](en/contornos#contorno-attributes) you want to change and who has the authority to adapt it.

# Participation in contornos
Participation in contornos happens through the allocation of people. It is possible to indicate the [type of energy](en/apps#type-of-energy-in-contorno) that each participant will have in a certain contorno.

Any participant in a contorno has these **common responsibilities**:
* perceive and treat [boosters](#boosters) of its contorno.
* prioritize projects and tasks according to the reason for existing and the strategy of the contornos in which it participates.
* share any information related to your contorno ー projects, tasks, etc ー when someone asks, unless something is agreed to be confidential.
* perform whatever is necessary to express the reason for existing and the strategy of the contornos in which it participates, respecting [agreements](#agreements), [strategy](#strategy-how), [process](#process-how) and [resources of exclusive control]#resources-of-exclusive-control-how).
* and, when necessary, carry out the above responsibility also for the contornos that **does not** participate, taking into account these rules:
  * consider the context and available information of the current structure and the risk or opportunity.
  * make the best judgment possible with what you have at your disposal.
  * perform the actions you deem appropriate and necessary.
  * notify participants of this contorno.

## Structural Roles
There are only two basic structural roles in Contornos: guardian and agent.

In addition to these two structural roles, it is possible to install [extra structural roles](en/apps#extra-structural-roles), such as: [Delegate](en/apps#delegate), [Synapse](en/apps#synapse), [Facilitator](en/apps#facilitator) and [Secretary](en/apps#secretary).

### Guardian

#### Reason for existing
  * keep the contorno space and answer for its reason for existing.

#### Participation
  * every guardian of a contorno is also a participant in the outer contorno as [agent](#agent).

#### Responsibilities
  * _all general responsibilities of outline participants_.
  * _all responsibilities of the contour itself_ that are not delegated to internal contours.
  * bring external contour information to all participants in your contour. If the outline in question is the organization itself, then bring information from the market, partners, investors, etc.
  * act on [boosters](#boosters) with no progress in its outline.
  * propose a contorno strategy, requiring an integrative decision.
  * propose a contorno process, needing an integrative decision.
  * propose people to support the contorno.
  * take action on direct internal contornos without participants: invite people to them or remove the contorno, with integrative decision.
  * keep indicators updated in the system that the organization uses to work together.
  * keep the progress of projects up to date in the system that the organization uses to work together.

----

#### Adaptation of the Guardian structural role
It is possible to delegate Guardian responsibilities to other internal contornos by integrative decision and recorded as "Delegated Guardian structural role" so that when you are in the removal process, remember to redeem the responsibility for the Guardian structural role.

#### Guardian structural role restrictions
The guardian has no authority to:
  * add new responsibilities to your role.
  * hire new people into the organization or fire people.
    * to solve both cases there may be a [special contorno](en/apps#special-contornos) for this or a [structural agreement](#structural-agreements) that determines how hiring and firing will be done. But this is not a responsibility of the structural Guardian role, nor is it in its authority.
  * micromanage or violate other contorno agreements or resources of exclusive control, including internal contornos.
  * require **exclusive** detailed reporting from someone about tasks.
    * if someone's intention, including those in the structural guardian role, is to have updates, specifics, or projections of something on demand, they can ask these questions of anyone directly.
    * if the contorno so desires, it is possible to create a structural agreement about group sharing rituals, either in meetings or through some tool, determining the frequency to be performed.

### Agent

#### Reason for existing
  * evolve the contorno towards the reason for existing.

#### Participation
  * if the agent is not also the guardian of some internal contorno, its participation is restricted to the contorno as an agent.
  * if the agent is also the guardian of some internal contorno, its participation happens both in the contorno as agent and in the internal contorno as guardian.

#### Responsibilities
  * _all general contorno participant responsibilities_.
  * _all own contorno responsibilities_ that are not delegated to internal contornos.

## Quick comparison
| | Guardian | Agent |
| -- | -- | -- |
| reason to exist | keep the contorno space and answer for its reason for existing. | evolve the contorno towards the reason for existing. |
| participation | every guardian of a contorno is also a participant in the outer contorno as [agent](#agent). | if the agent is not the guardian of some internal contorno, her participation is restricted to the contorno as an agent.<br/>If the agent is the guardian of some internal contorno, her participation happens both in the contorno as agent and in the contorno as guardian. |

## Allocation of people in contornos
To be able to be allocated in any way, a person must be a partner of the organization, whatever the form: hired collaborator, partner or other agreed form. And to become a partner, it is expected that there is some contorno with this responsibility, such as the [Partnership Maintenance](en/apps#partnership-maintainance).

After becoming a partner, people can be dynamically allocated to contornos over time.

The allocation of people differs depending on the structural role that will be played in the contorno.

When the revaluation period arrives, or when any contorno participant creates a booster with this order, it is necessary to carry out a [evaluation](#general-evaluation).

### Guardian and agent allocation
#### Guardian
A guardian for a new inner contorno is appointed by integrative decision by all participants of the **external** contorno.
 
#### Agent
To allocate new agents in the contorno, the guardian makes a proposal or asks for a [nomination process] (en/apps#nominating-people-to-a-contorno), requiring an integrative decision between participants of the contorno.

Anyone can apply as an agent of a contorno at any time, taking the matter to the guardian of the contorno. The guardian of the contorno can deny the request or bring the contorno to an integrative decision, if it considers the person's inclusion.

Also, anyone can appoint a person to the structural role of agent and make an integrative decision.

### Beware of focus and time
Before making an allocation proposal to a new contorno, ask yourself:
- How many hours do you want to be invested in this contorno? and how often?

When making an integrative decision of [naming](en/apps#nominating-of-people-to-a-contorno), question yourself as an objection enhancer:
- does the person have the time and focus necessary for this other contorno? It is indicated that the person himself also assess for possible objection if he is with cognitive overload to be in many different contexts that require routine activities.

### Allocation revaluation
When allocating a person to a contorno, it is necessary to define the frequency of revaluation of this allocation.
Guardians and agents will have their participation [evaluated periodically] (en/apps#evaluation-in-a-contorno), according to the definition of frequency, in the contornos in which they participate.

It is recommended to use the [Appraisal in a contorno](en/apps#appraisal-in-a-contorno).

### Withdrawal of people from contornos
Anyone can opt out of a contorno by notifying the participants of the contorno in advance.
And anyone can suggest that a person is removed from a contorno, however, in this case, needing an integrative decision in it.

Withdrawing from a contorno is different from terminating a partnership contract with the organization. It just means that the person will come out of a contorno.

If a person no longer participates in any other contorno or is in contornos that do not use the agreed time to hire the person, they must take this issue to a contorno that has responsibility for allocating people throughout the organization, such as [Allocation Advice](en/apps#allocation-advice).
Or, if the intention is to end the partnership, take the issue directly to a contorno responsible for this scope, such as the [Partnership Maintenance special contorno](en/apps#partnership-maintenance) .

If these special contornos do not exist, the case should be taken to the larger contorno of the organization, asking to know about contornos that it could participate in or, if it is her intention, asking to end the partnership.

# Contorno attributes
Each contorno has a list of attributes. Several of the attributes listed below are connected by the 'Why' questions will we do something? -> 'How' will we do something? -> 'What' will we do?.

Rule:
- for any change of attribute of a contorno it is necessary to notify its external contorno and internal contornos.

## Nickname and Scope

### Nickname
This attribute is intended to uniquely identify the contorno, and therefore cannot have its name repeated by more than one contorno.
Any nickname can be used, from real names to invented names.

The definition of the contorno nickname is determined by the participants of the contorno itself in an integrative decision.

### Scope
This attribute allows you to quickly understand the scope of the contorno. This attribute is not to uniquely identify the contorno, but to represent what the scope of the contorno is. Examples of names: Product, Development, Design, Finance, etc.
It is possible and even expected that there will be repeated scopes throughout the organization.

The definition of the scope name is determined by the external contorno in an integrative decision.

### How to uniquely identify a contorno?
Suppose we want to cite a "frontend" scope loop in an organization that already has several other "frontend" scope loops.

To uniquely identify, we could:
  * use the [nickname](#nickname) attribute that the contorno defined.
    * example: ```Frontend XYZ Javascript Masters```.
  * use [hierarchy annotation](en/curiosities#about-hierarchy-annotation-for-contorno-dentification) with the scopes of the contornos.
    * To use this annotation format, start with the name of the largest contorno in the organization and move to the current contorno using the "." (dot) as a connector.
      * for example, if you want to quote the "frontend" contorno, which is inside the "implementation" contorno, which is inside the "XYZ product" contorno, and which ultimately is inside the "ABC organization", you can use the note:
        * ```ABC organization.XYZ product.implementation.frontend```.

## Reason for existing (’Why?’)
The reason for existing tells why a contorno exists. The contornos are aligned and nested by it.

Rules:
* the statement must be made from the perspective that the contorno meets and, preferably, measurable. In the case of the largest contorno, the organization, the statement of the reason for existing must be made from the perspective of the audience that the organization serves. In the case of other contornos, they can be from the external or internal audience, depending on the contorno.
* avoid amplified words or unattainable aspirations that hinder comprehension and cannot be measured.
* it is decided by the external contorno through integrative decision.

## Responsibilities (’How?’)
[Responsibilities](en/questions#how-to-define-a-contorno-responsibilities) are expectations agreements about the main recurring actions that the people of a contorno will take care of. They make explicit any things that are not easily deduced from reading the reason for existing.

People have the authority to act and do whatever is necessary to express the reason for the existence of a contorno, even if something is not listed in the responsibilities, without the need for approval from other people outside their contorno, and it is necessary to respect [agreements] (#agreements), [strategy](#strategy-how), [process](#process-how) and [resources of exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) of other contornos .

It is important to know that, intentionally, the responsibilities **do not prevent other contornos from doing something described in the responsibilities**.
To prevent this from happening it is necessary to create a structural [agreement](#agreements) that prevents other contornos from doing anything or assign [resource of exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) to the contorno itself.

The responsibilities of a contorno are decided by the external contorno through integrative decision.

### Operational decisions
They are situational decisions, not foreseen and defined in agreements, strategy and process, and which are within the scope of reason to exist and responsibilities of some kind.

![Operating decisions](assets/decisions.png)

If an operational decision of a contorno:
- It is safe, whether reversible or irreversible: the contorno participant makes the decision, without the need to consult other people. Contorno participants already have the authority to decide. **Most decisions will likely fit here. The idea of ​​the [Contornos] system is precisely to distribute decisions and authority.**
- It is risky and reversible: it is recommended that the contorno participant consults with more people, but still has authority over the decision. That is, she doesn't need to try to please, adapt or justify her decision. The intention is for her to have more knowledge and perspective on the subject and context before making a decision.
- It is irreversible and risky: it is recommended that the contorno participant makes an [integrative decision](#integrative-decisions) with the other contorno participants.

We evolved to make decisions very quickly based on a partial data scan, favoring our most recent or most memorable experiences [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule), [ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)]. Therefore, the intention is to minimize our biases and increase the data to make better decisions in certain contexts, as suggested above, and still have ways to move forward without being paralyzed. 

## Strategy (’How?’)
A strategy is an explicit statement of guidelines, safety limits or minimum criteria that facilitate decision making, prioritization, and boundary-reasoning experiments. It must be aligned with the external contour strategy.

It is possible to contain [simple rules, minimum restrictions, disclaimers or recurring practices (checklist)](en/references#references-about-strategy).

The strategy is proposed by the contorno guardian, **aligned with the external contorno strategy** and defined in [integrative decision](#integrative-decision) in the contorno itself.

When a strategy is changed, it is necessary to review the indicators so that, in addition to bringing information related to the reason for the existence of the contorno, they can also contemplate the new strategy. Furthermore, it is necessary to notify the external contorno.

From there, prioritize projects that are aligned with the new strategy.

## Process (’How?’)
![process](assets/process.png)

Contornos that have demand processing with expected steps to follow, must specify as [process](en/references#references-about-process-mapping).
A process is nothing more than a structural agreement, which is why it needs an integrative decision. However, it is an attribute of the contorno.

Understanding the demands and steps will help to know what kind of other internal contornos will be needed to deliver the work and deliver the result.

The process must be done from the perspective of demand and the value delivered - whoever asks for, needs or will receive the result of the work, with the intention of minimizing ambiguity and waste, aligning expectations, minimizing decision fatigue and maintaining the level of quality, making explicit recurrent, planned and necessary deliveries (_handover_ or _handoff_), identifying how the contornos interact and which are responsible for the steps and actions.

Rules:
* process mapping is the responsibility of the guardian, consulting people involved in the process.
* [integrative decision](#integrative-decisions) is required to use it in the contorno.
* capture all the necessary steps in a flow without getting to the level of predicting small tasks.
* start with the question: what is the first thing that is done or needs to be done when a demand arrives? And then ask: what's the next thing? Continue with this question until you answer the question: What needs to be completed to deliver the result?

## Resources of exclusive control (’How?’)
Each contorno can have resources (material, digital or conceptual) of exclusive control. Anyone from another contorno wishing to manipulate this resource will need to ask for the desired action from the contorno's participants who have exclusive control.

The inner contornos inherit the resources of exclusive control of the outer contorno.

It is important to remember that no one person in the organization has control over the resources, but the very contorno in which it belongs. If at any point she leaves the contorno, she loses exclusive control of the resource.

For some contorno to have exclusive control over some resource it is necessary [integrative decision](#integrative-decisions) by the external contorno.

If a contorno has exclusive control over the organization's resources as a whole (eg, hiring process or official tools), it can make decisions without the need for an integrative decision on the impacted contornos. However, it is recommended to ask for reactions about possible changes when something impacts too many contornos or when there is a great risk.

Simple rule:
- encourage the resources of exclusive control to belong to the contornos that have the responsibilities of caring for and using the resources.

## Projects (’What?’)
It is suggested that every contorno has its own project board where it can give visibility to the progress of its projects.

Projects have frequency of sharing over update defined by the outer contorno. The project contorno guardian shares the main points of progress, as well as referencing how this connects to the outer circle strategy.

Projects and tasks are the “what” that connects with the “how” ーstrategy + responsibilities + sole control ー that connects with the “why” ー reason to exist.

### Request for projects or tasks

Rules:
* Anyone in the organization can create a [booster](#boosters) to ask for projects or tasks to the contorno guardian responsible for a given scope.
* The trigger containing the Project or task request necessarily needs to contain the motivation and context, so that the guardian acting on the Project or task can more deeply understand and connect with the request.
* It is not necessary to ask if the person wants, has the time or thinks it is important, nor to worry if you are bothering when placing an order. The contorno already foresees these responsibilities. The person who is the guardian is in that role to serve. She's not doing you a favor, but just the combined work.
* The contorno guardian who receives the order will seek to better understand the need and whether this is within the scope of your contorno.
* The guardian of the contorno for which the request was made has the authority to prioritize the project or task as it suits her, **taking into account the contorno strategy**, not having the duty to prioritize by the will or discretion of a external person. At the same time, it is expected that there is negotiation and influence between people on these aspects.
* The guardian does not have the duty to give or inform any specific delivery date, but, if asked, only a projection, as the prioritization of projects and tasks is dynamic, depending on the context. An exception may exist if the guardian herself agrees something with a specific delivery date or if there is some structural agreement that defines a different process.

Question that the guardian can ask the person who made the request:
- What do you need?

Questions the guardian can ask herself:
- Is this within a contorno that I'm part of ー reason for existing, responsibilities or resources of exclusive control? Which?
  - If so, the guardian will record the project or task in a list, accessible to others.
    - If she has any objection to the request, she must deal with the person who asked to try to integrate the objection and finally agree on whether or not it will be carried out.
  - If not, the guardian asks herself and the other person:
    - What contorno currently has this scope?
      - If there is a responsible contorno, the person who made the order must take you to this contorno.
      - Otherwise, the person who created the order themselves can try to process the order trigger and/or invite people they deem important to help resolve the trigger.

## Agreements
Agreements are intentional limits that leverage value creation and guide future decisions and actions.
At the same time, the more agreements and the more specifics, the tendency is to have less flexibility, autonomy and space to adapt the structure fluidly and people flourish.

The [Contornos] system itself is an agreement for the development of the organizational structure.
However, from then onwards, new agreements may be necessary.

There are two types of agreements: structural and personal. Both can be adapted, and any participant in the contorno can suggest a modification proposal.

Rules:
* Create agreements when recurring issues arise that require the same type of decision.
* Avoid trying to predict something in agreements without evidence or knowledge.
* Agreements are made to define structural or personal expectations to be met.
* An agreement must be created only with [integrative decision](#integrative-decisions) between the contorno participants.
* Agreements can only restrict or create expectations within their own inner contorno and contornos as long as they do not violate the exclusive control of other outer contornos.
* If an agreement proposal is also related to the reason for existing, responsibilities, strategy, process or resources of exclusive control of other contornos outside the current contorno, it is indicated that there is an evaluation of the proposal with the guardians of these other contornos and that a integrative decision with them.

**Time for reassessment**

It is indicated that agreements have defined the time for revaluation. And when the date arrives, the agreement is evaluated to understand if it still makes sense in the new context and goes through an integrative decision to remain valid.

### Structural Agreements
Structural agreements are related to the organizational structure and its contornos, not creating expectations about people.

Examples of structural agreements:
- creation or adaptation of contornos, contorno attributes, protocols, strategy, processes, ceremonies
- [apps](apps)
- and even the [Contornos] system itself.

Create and adapt new framework agreements as needed, as per boosterrs.

### Personal Agreements
Personal agreements are related to people, such as behavior and personal expectations, not creating expectations about structure.

## Indicators
Each contorno has indicators that can be shared by more than one contorno.

Indicators can be **metric** (metrics) [1] or **confirmation** [2] of recurrent practice.
Although indicators rarely provide definitive answers about something, they promote conversations, discoveries, understanding and support decision-making and adaptations using a common base.

1. a contorno will possibly have indicators of the **metric** type, decided by the outer contorno, to indicate health and results.
2. if the strategy also has recurrent practices to be carried out, probably the contorno itself will define **confirmation** type indicators to inform whether such practice is being carried out in the expected recurrence (eg, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

**Rules:**
- the external contorno defines, by integrative decision, the main contorno indicators. Remembering that the guardian of the contorno is a participant in the external contorno.
- the contorno itself can also add other indicators of the metric or confirmation type, related to your strategy.
- Indicators have frequency of sharing on update defined by the outer contorno. The contorno guardian shares the last result of the indicators at the agreed frequency.

**Recommendation:**
- are related to aspects of quality and quantity in relation to the reason for existing, strategy and generated value generated **in the perspective of customers of the contornos or engagement of people of the contornos**.
 - changes in the strategy of a contorno lead to adaptations of some indicators that may reflect the execution and result of the strategy.
 - changes in the way that customers evaluate a result lead to adaptations of some indicators that may reflect the evaluation of that result. 

### Metric type indicators
Categories:
- **health**, to monitor important aspects of the business, service, product or people engagement in a contorno. It is possible to have lower and upper bound that indicate the range of health. Examples of metrics indicator model, without delimiters, related to people engagement with a product or service:
- **result**, indicators that customers - internal or external - use in their decision-making and choice of services or products. It is possible to have a lower and/or higher delimiter. Below the lower limit, it is not meeting customer needs. Above superior may indicate that customers do not perceive the added benefits and may also be overserving unnecessarily when it causes harm to other aspects of the business, service or product.
- **survival**, containing a target, in an exceptional case only when it is necessary to promote a quick change to save the business, product or service.

**Recommendation:**
- are based on results and not on activities (outcome-based and not activity-based).
- are composed of leading and lagging indicators. Early indicators tell us about trends and predictive signals. Late indicators confirm an ongoing trend, related to throughput measurement. This includes, for example, information on whether a contorno is solving your demands.

# Who defines each contorno attribute?

| attribute | the outer contorno | the contorno itself |
| -- | -- | -- |
| nickname | | ✔️ |
| scope | ✔️ | |
| reason to exist | ✔️ | |
| responsibilities | ✔️ | |
| resources of exclusive control | ✔️ | |
| strategy | | ✔️ |
| process | | ✔️ |
| indicators | ✔️ (defines the main ones) | ✔️ (can add others) |

## Exception: greater contorno, the organization itself

If the contorno in question is the largest contorno, the organization itself, then everything that depends on the external contorno - which does not exist in this case - is carried out by the participants of the contorno itself with an integrative decision.

# Boosters
Boosters is everything that boosts the organization's learning or adaptation or the learning and care of people.
The boosters are expected to flow continuously.

Rules:
- Any participant of a contorno has the responsibility to realize and deal with boosters related to its contornos or its person.
- Register boosters in some shared list for processing.
- [Declare type of the booster](#types-of-boosters) for processing.
- Describe the motivation and context of the booster.
- When creating a booster it is necessary to declare from which contorno you are creating the booster and for which contorno. Ex: "Development contorno for Product contorno". The only exception is when it is something personal, unrelated to the organizational structure (contorno, reason for existing, responsibilities, strategy, process, indicator, resources of exclusive control, agreements) or operational work (projects and tasks).
- A trigger is expected to be pulled by any participant who has responsibility for dealing with the trigger context.
- It is necessary that the boosters are pulled and dealt with one by one, with a focus on the context and intention of the booster. Do not collectivize the booster by seeking to modify what is expected, bringing in other people's concerns and intentions, unless it is a request from the person who opened the original booster.
  - When dealing with a booster, as soon as someone realizes that the focus left that booster or the person who brought it, it deviated from the subject, left the expected type of the booster or started to add boosters from other people in the booster of the person who shared it, **it is necessary to warn and interrupt to bring the focus back to the subject, type and person who shared the booster**.

## Types of boosters
When registering a booster, specify its type:
- **Notification**: when you want to notify about something without necessarily waiting for reactions.
- **Celebration**: when you want to celebrate something.
- **Request**: when you want to request something from a contorno or someone: information, project or task.
- **Listening**: when a person wants to be heard or understood by others. Examples of supporting tools: open questions, summary or [reflections](https://nelianafiglie.com.br/blog/tipos-de-reflexao-2/).
- **Reaction** (feedback): when someone wants emotional reactions, opinions or ideas, but is not necessarily expected to respond to the reactions.
- **Discussion**: when you want to discuss ideas and points of view.
- **Co-creation of proposal**: when you want to make a [group ideation and create a proposal](#ideation-and-proposal-co-creation).
- **[Integrative decision](#integrative-decision)**: when there is a proposal to be decided in an integrative way. If necessary, specify which contorno has the authority to decide or which contorno the decision is expected from.

### Usage examples
| Imagine that... | Type of booster... |
| -- | -- |
| there is an agreed recurring meeting that no longer makes sense to one person and there is a desire to modify or cancel that meeting | **integrative decision** with the proposed modification or cancellation. |
| a person wants to create a proposal about a project that is already in charge of its contorno but wants to make the proposal in a collaborative way | **co-creation of proposal. |
| a participant needs to make an integration between two company software and there is a contorno that takes care of integrations or company technology | **action request** by a project for this. |
| a participant needs to make an integration between two company software and there is no contorno to take care of it | **action request** for a project to the guardian of some contorno that encompasses the larger scope of the booster (eg product) to process that booster and in parallel **decision integrative** proposing the creation of a specific contorno for this, if it is a recurring project type. |
| a participant left a contorno and would like to notify the participants of this contorno | **notification**. |
| a person of a certain contorno is feeling overwhelmed and has the perception that it is necessary to have someone else as an agent in the contorno to divide projects and tasks. | **integrative decision** for a proposal to allocate a person as an agent in the contorno. |
| a person has gained a child and would like to share the news with the participants of the contornos in which he works. | **celebration**. |
| a person is having difficulty discussing important matters through the company's official tool because there are messages sent to other people in the area that go over 5 days without replies. | **integrative decision** with a proposal for a personal agreement that foresees the need to respond to messages that other people have marked you within 48 hours. |

The possibilities of boosters are almost endless, appearing all the time in the complexity of daily life and favoring the organization's continuous adaptation.

# Integrative decision
Integrative decision is a type of decision **in consent** involving all participants in a decision. When not specified, by default, an integrative decision involves all participants in a contorno.

Consent is not a matter of personal preference, but whether there are objections.

## Valid objections
In contorno, there are 3 criteria to consider a valid objection:
  1. **Violation or Obstacle**: reveals a violation of the organization's agreements or reveals obstacles, specifically for the contornos of who raised the objection, to expressing their reason for existing and carrying out their responsibilities. If the person raises an objection on behalf of contornos he does not participate in, do not consider a valid objection. The guardians of each contorno may raise their own objections.
  2. **Damage caused by the proposal**: reveals damage that will only exist if the proposal is put into practice and that there will not be adequate opportunity for adaptation before the proposal causes the damage.
  3. **Evidence**: it needs to based on evidence. If it is predictive and does not pass on criteria 2, do not consider it a valid objection in this process.

If there are objections, the person making the proposal must adapt it to integrate the objections. If this is not possible, the proposal is filed.
If there is adaptation, it is necessary to consent to the change with the contorno participants.

An integrative decision, by default, is made for all structural agreements.

It is recommended that you use the [proposal integrative decision] app (en/apps#integrative-proposal-decision).
 
If a decision impacts other contornos, it is recommended that you share the proposal for the reactions of people from the impacted contornos, and only then make an integrative decision on the contorno that created the proposal.

## Process for proposal with integrative decision
### Ideation and co-creation of proposal
To create a collaborative proposal, use this process:

- **Introduction of the booster with context**
- **Clarification**: make a round where everyone will have the opportunity, one by one, to ask questions to fully understand the proposal. One question at a time. As soon as questions arise, the person who proposes can answer. If anyone has an opinion or suggestion, let them know to save it for the next step. The step is for clarification only.
- **Reactions**: make a round where everyone will have the opportunity, one by one, to offer any reaction on the proposal or suggestion that could help improve the proposal. The proposing person listens to all reactions but does not respond to them.
- **Criteria discovery**: Run a round so people can share criteria they feel they need to take into account. (eg budget, time, entertainment level, schedule, screen design, flow)
- **Criteria selection**: the person who brought the booster selects the criteria they consider important and makes an integrative decision. If she wishes, she can delegate this selection of criteria to someone else.
- **Ideation for selected criteria**: make a round where each person presents ideas for any of the selected criteria. Ideas can be contradictory. The intention is to create options.
- **Nomination of bidders**: whoever brought the booster, nominates 1 to 3 people to prepare the proposal and makes an integrative decision. She can volunteer. If she wishes, she can delegate this appointment of people to someone else.
- **Preparation of proposal**: moment in which the person(s) nominated seek inspiration in what was conceived and prepare a proposal. It is possible to choose some ideas, forgo others and invent others.
- **[Integrative proposal decision](#integrative-proposal-decision)**

### Integrative proposal decision
When submitting a proposal for integrative decision, use this process:
- **Proposal**: a written proposal is created to deal with some issue.
- **Clarification**: make a round where everyone will have the opportunity, one by one, to ask questions to fully understand the proposal. One question at a time. As soon as questions arise, the person who proposes can answer. If anyone has an opinion or suggestion, let them know to save it for the next step. The step is for clarification only.
- **Reactions**: make a round where everyone will have the opportunity, one by one, to offer any reaction on the proposal or suggestion that could help improve the proposal. The person proposing listens to all reactions but does not need to respond to them.
- **Amends**: based on the questions and reactions, the proposing person can change the proposal (or not) and clarify anything that was not already explicit and specific.
- **Integrative decision**:
  - the proposing person seeks consent to his/her proposal, adjusted or not.
  - if any participant has an objection, she declares it to the bidder.
  - if it is a valid objection, the tenderer must adapt the proposal to address the objections. and then the process goes back to the **clarification** stage above, where people can ask questions about the changes and goes to the next stages: reactions, amends and integrative decision.

### Asynchronous integrative decision
The integrative decision can be performed asynchronously using the [asynchronous integrative-decision of proposal] app (en/apps#integrative-asynchronous-of-proposal-decision).

# Extraordinary action
Extraordinary actions are expected to occur violanting strategy, process, resources of exclusive control or agreements.

These actions meet two needs:
* prevent or mitigate negative impacts or address a critical opportunity.
* shed light on limitations of the current structure.

Condition for extraordinary actions:
* negative impacts or critical opportunities that, in anyone's judgment, cannot wait for the adaptation of attributes from one contorno or processing one booster on the authority of another contorno.

Rules for performing an extraordinary action:
* consider the context and available information of the current structure and the risk or opportunity.
* make the best judgment possible with what you have at your disposal.
* perform the actions you deem appropriate.

Rules after extraordinary action:
* reveal the extraordinary action to the guardians of the impacted contornos, through a [booster](#boosters) with [warning intent](en/apps#declare-intention).
* create a [booster](#boosters) of [integrative decision](#types-of-boosters), proposing adaptations in contornos or agreements, if that resolves the issue when something similar comes up again.
