# Comparison between social technologies
This table is a risky and simplistic attempt so that people who are familiar with the other technologies listed can have a superficial notion of comparison about the elements foreseen in the core of each technology.
This table does not provide contextual information for those who are not familiar with these technologies.

If you don't know the other social technologies, here's my invitation to know, learn and be inspired by them too. Go to the [comparative-table](#comparative-table-of-other-differences) below and click on the link containing the name of the social technology.

❤️ I thank all the people and organizations that helped to evolve all these social technologies.

## Important

It is important to remember that all these elements and characteristics of the social technologies below can be changed through an integrative decision, adding or removing something. In fact, the integrative decision itself ca change the way of making decisions.

## Difference in favoring number of participants
A difference between the [Contornos] system and other technologies is the way in which the number of participants in a contorno grows.
In [Contornos], to delimit a new scope within a contorno, there is only the possibility to create a new contorno. So, by allocating more people to work in this new scope, in the internal contorno, they will only participate in this contorno, as agents, and therefore they will not participate in the external contorno, where the guardian will participate.

In other technologies, on the other hand, by delimiting a scope, it is possible to create a role or circle. And it's common to start with creating a role instead of a circle. Therefore, if a new scope is defined as a role and allocating several people in the role, they will all be participating in the same larger circle, favoring the growth of the number of participants per circle in the organization.

### Summary:
- [Contornos] favors having fewer participants per contorno. However, it is possible to invite people from an internal contorno to participate as agents of an external contorno. Or, create arrangements for ceremonies that involve guardians or agents of other, inner contornos.
  - By default, the tendency is to have fewer participants with alternative to allocating more participants in a contorno intentionally.
- Other social technologies favor having more participants per contorno when using roles. However, it is possible to create a circle to encompass the responsibilities of a role by allocating the role participants in that circle, and leaving only one person participating in the outer circle as a link.
  - What seems to be common is the creation of role before creating a circle, and therefore, the tendency is to have more participants per circle.

### Example
- In the case of the [Contornos] system:
  - Imagine that we have a Product contorno. Now we want to create a Development contorno. By allocating more people in the Development contorno, we will not be increasing the number of participants in the Product contorno, as only the guardian will be part of it.
- In the case of the other technologies mentioned:
  - In the same case as above, imagine that we have a Product circle. Now we want to create a Development role as the most common option. By allocating more people to this role, we will be increasing the number of Product contorno participants. The option would be to create a Development circle to minimize the number of participants in the outer circle.
