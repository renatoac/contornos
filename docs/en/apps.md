# Apps

Apps are pre-defined extra [structural agreements](en/contornos#structural-agreements) ready to solve some intentionally unmet needs at the heart of the operating system [Contornos](#contornos).

An app can have a dependency on other apps, if specified.

In addition to the Apps included here, see also:
- [Curiosities](en/curiosities)
- [Questions and Answers](en/questions)
- [References](en/references)

# How to use the Apps

## Extra structural roles
### Delegate

#### Reason for existing
  * represent needs and perspectives of the current contorno in other contornos, in addition to perceiving needs of other contornos where it has participation.

#### Term time for new nomination process
  * 6 months

#### Participation
  * the delegate of a contorno becomes a participant in the external contorno.

#### Responsibilities
  * _all general contorno participant responsibilities_.
  * _all responsibilities of the contorno itself_.
  * share perspectives from the current contorno in other contornos in which you participate.
  * participate in integrative decisions of the contornos in which it participates.

#### Simple rules
* Every contorno that has participants in addition to the guardian will also have a delegate, except for the larger contorno, the organization itself.
* The delegate must be a participant in the contorno and cannot be the same person assigned to guardian role.
* The delegate becomes an automatic participant in the external contorno. The delegate enhances more perspectives about her contorno in the decisions of the external contorno together with the guardian.
* A delegate is nominated by integrative decision by the participants of the contorno in which she will be allocated.
* A delegate will have her participation evaluated periodically, according to the definition of frequency, in the circumstances in which she participates.

#### Delegate in other parts of the organization
- Any contorno can create a booster and generate a proposal for the contorno where you want to have a delegate, allocating a person from your contorno in that other contorno.
- Any contorno of the organization can generate a booster with a proposal for itself and create a delegate, requesting allocation of a person of the contorno who wants a delegate.

If the contorno that will offer a delegate already has a named delegate, it will automatically be allocated to this new structural role of the contorno that generated the booster. Otherwise, the contorno that a delegate will offer, needs to name and allocate a person in that structural role.

#### Nomination
- Each person in the contorno writes in private who they nominate as delegate: I nominate PERSON X to act in that contorno as Delegate. Remind everyone that each of them can nominate themselves.
- Nomination Announcement Round: In one round, ask each person to briefly announce their nomination and reasons.
- Change round: in a round, offer people the opportunity to change their nomination. If anyone changes their nomination, ask if they want to share what led to the change.
- Proposal and integrative decision: the guardian makes a proposal taking into account the names and reasons that other people brought in the nominations. Participants make an integrative decision.

### Synapse
#### Reason for existing
  * offer perspectives from various parts of the organization for integrative decision-making on issues that directly impact multiple contornos or people in the organization, in addition to bringing fresh eyes from these people with important questions about the status quo.

#### Mandate time for new draw
  * Four months

#### Responsibilities
  * actively participate in all contorno decision making that directly impact multiple contornos or people in the organization.

#### Simple rules
  * current contorno decisions that directly impact multiple contornos cease to be operational and become integrative decisions including people in structural role of synapse.
  * every 4 months, 4 people from any level of internal contornos are randomly selected to participate in the structural role of synapse.
  * people drawn may object to their participation. If the contorno fails to integrate the objection, a new lottery is made to fill the vacancy of the people who objected.

#### Examples of decisions with a direct impact on multiple contornos or people:
  * financial decisions of the organization
  * organization strategy
  * selection or evaluation process questions
  * behavioral agreements of the organization as a whole
  * etc
  
## Special contornos
### North
**Reason for existing:**
- define the north of the organization

**Responsibilities**:
- define the organization's strategy
- define investments by companies or third parties in the organization
- define the organization's financing and loans
- define the program, purchase and sale of options to purchase shares or shares of the organization

**Exclusive Control Features:**
- organization strategy
- investments by companies or third parties in the organization
- financing and loans from the organization
- options to purchase shares or shares of the organization

**Internal structural agreement:**
- all decisions made in the contorno will be by integrative decision.
- the North contorno will have the [structural role of synapse](#synapse), with 4 people drawn from the organization.
- the guardian of the greatest contorno, the organization itself, no longer has the organization's strategy as an exclusive control resource.
- the guardian of the highest contorno, the organization itself, and the guardian of the "North" contorno delegate the responsibility for defining the organization's strategy to the participants of the "North" contorno.

**To define:**
- criteria that inform which people will participate in this contorno, in addition to those drawn. Example: first and second level contorno guardians; people with more than X years in the organization + people who invested more than X in the organization + people invited by the contorno participants who go through an integrative decision.

### Partnership

**Reason for existing:**
- take care of hiring, contract closures and salary changes.

**Exclusive Control Features:**
- signings
- contract terminations
- change of salary

**Internal structural agreement:**
- decisions of this contorno will be made by integrative decision.
- the guardians of contornos that will be impacted - whether for a hiring, termination of partnership or salary change, will participate in the integrative decision.

**To define:**
- which guardians of the organization's contornos participate in this contorno.

### Organizational System

**Reason for existing:**
- support the understanding of context and experimentation with organizational artifacts

**Responsibilities:**
- research and interview employees of the organization
- support the structuring of organizational experiments and the continuity of experiments
- structure acquired learning and share with the organization

**Exclusive Control Features:**
- definition of artifacts used by the entire organization

**Internal structural agreement:**
- avoid internal contornos containing only dedicated and exclusive people as the only participant. Leverage the involvement of people in the organization who are in other contornos and who engage with the aspect or theme in question.
- when starting an internal contorno to focus on a certain organizational aspect or theme, ask the people in the organization to nominate a number of people, as needed by the contorno, and they can nominate themselves.
  - criteria: engagement with the topic, knowledge of the topic, time for dedication and skills.
  - the most suitable people are evaluated and proposed by the Organizational System contorno and undergo an integrative decision with each person selected in turn.


### Allocation advice
Contorno to advise people who wish to participate in other contornos or are no longer participating in any contorno.

If they do not jointly discover some other contorno for participation or fail to decide the contornos, the "Allocation Advice" participants combine with the Partnership contorno to handle the case.

### Mentoring
Contorno to advise, direct and train in specific skills.

### Conflict Mediation
[To be developed]

### Listening
I get around people with the intention of listening empathically, without counseling.

## Asynchronous integrative proposal decision
[Under development]

One of the difficulties in asynchronous integrative decision is being able to go through the process of [integrative decision of a proposal] (en/contornos#integrative-decision-of-proposal) in a reasonable time and without being forgotten, so here there are two models for inspiration.

#### Model 1

To achieve fluidity in the asynchronous integrative decision process:
* We determine that all proposals will be valid for 30 days, after which it is archived or reopened by whoever created it.
* we determine the minimum waiting period at each stage:
  * **Clarification**: 48h.
  * **Reaction**: 48h.
  * **Amends**: 72h.
  * **[Integrative decision](en/contornos#integrative-decisions)**: the time remaining before the 30 days expire. If the validity days pass, the proposal is filed.

#### Model 2

To achieve fluidity in the asynchronous integrative decision process:
* We determine that all proposals will be valid for 30 days, after which it is archived or reopened by whoever created it.
* we determine the minimum waiting period at each stage:
  * **Clarification**: 48h.
  * **Reaction**: 48h.
  * **Amends**: 72h.
  * **[Integrative decision](en/contornos#dintegrative-decisions)**: 72h.
    * criteria:
       * 70% of people in the contorno must declare that they have no objection, as long as 70% equals at least 5 people.
       * otherwise, the participation of 100% of people in this stage is required and the proposal is waiting until the 30 days expire.

## Meetings and Ceremonies
Get inspired here: [References on meeting formats and possible templates to use for contorno meetings](en/references#meeting-formats-and-possible-templates-to-use-for-contorno-meetings)

## Collaboration and Communication

### Talking in Rounds
Use speaking rounds to provide greater group equivalence and prevent more outgoing or influential people from having more power, or speaking time.

Process:
* clockwise (or counterclockwise), one person speaks at a time. if the synchronous conversation is through a digital tool, it is possible to create a shared list of participating people, in any order, and follow this list.
* it is recommended to use a maximum agreed time for each person to speak. if anyone has anything else to talk about, they can wait for the next round.
* make as many rounds as necessary.
 
### Person's Manual
This app provides for each person to complete their own manual based on the following items.
Model inspired and adapted [from here](https://medium.com/manuelkublbock/user-manual-3e93277ea4d1).

**Reason for existing**:
- share perceptions of yourself among people to increase empathy

**Template to use**

## Taking care of people
[Under development]

  - Non-Violent Communication
  - Empathic listening
  - Mediation of conflicts

## Type of energy in contorno
By installing this app, a person can define one or more types of energy in a contorno.

Below are the types a person can have in a contorno:
  - Focus
    > I invest at least 80% of my time here.
  - Specialty
    > This is my specialty. It is my tool to make money in the market. I have extensive experience in this field.
  - Purpose and values
    > Makes my work meaningful and is in line with my values. It contributes to my personal purpose.
  - Development
    > Participating in this contorno can help me to develop, practice, reflect and continually improve my skills. This role helps me step out of my comfort zone and challenge myself. It can help me explore other paths.
  - Volunteering
    > This is a contorno that has no guardian and I volunteer to assume it. Maybe it has nothing to do with my passion and purpose. I want to help the organization while I need it or I can.

## Apprentice Mentoring
People with energy type 'Development' need to consult with someone from the [Mentoring](#mentoring) contorno related to their scope for decision making and direction.

In addition, these people need to set a frequency of individual or group meetings with a Mentoring person.

**Apps Dependency:**
- [Type of energy in contorno](#type-of-energy-in-contorno)
- [Mentoring](#mentoring)

## Naming people for a contorno
The process of naming people serves any structural role, except for Guardian, for which [another process is applied](#guardian-nomination-in-a-contorno-evaluation-process).

A nomination process does not require initial convergence or consensus.

See the steps for naming:
- Each person writes in private who they nominate for a given contorno and function: I name PERSON X to fill in this contorno as [structural role name]. Remind everyone that each of them can nominate themselves.
- Nomination Announcement Round: In one round, ask each person to briefly announce their nomination and reasons.
- Change round: in a round, offer people the opportunity to change their nomination. If anyone changes their nomination, ask if they want to share what led to the change.
- Proposal and integrative decision: the guardian makes a proposal taking into account the names and reasons that other people brought in the nominations. Participants make an integrative decision by consent.

## Evaluation of people

The intention of this process is to recognize and evaluate the participation of people in the organization.

### Influencing expectations of mentoring, partnership or bonus variations

Participants in the process:
- participants of the contornos of the person to be evaluated
- anyone in the organization who wishes.

Rules:
- ask them to assess their own perception of the person.

Affirmations to give a grade from 1 to 5:
- given what I perceive about the person's performance, and if it were my money, I would always rehire that person with the highest pay in their range. (1–5)
- I would always choose this person to work with me. (1-5)
- Given what is expected of behaviors within the organization, for me this person is a perfect example. (1-5)

Notice:
- The words above were intentionally selected to favor reliability and cause variance in the data.
Learn more about this information [in the article on performance evaluation](https://medium.com/tentaculus/os-perigos-da-avalia%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-desempenho-nas-organiza%C3%A7%C3%B5es-21a92e261fe3).
- When talking about 'behaviors' above, put a link to some streamlined material, simple, practical, unambiguous and with examples of expected behaviors.

#### Agreements
When installing the app (importing the agreement), please describe the desired and necessary details:
- what is the frequency of this assessment. Example: bimonthly.
- what is the minimum expected mean of all people, regardless of contorno or structural role.
- how will the average be calculated: between the 3 questions?
- will the evaluation result be linked to the Partnership contorno (closure, promotion, or bonus variation)?
- what is the minimum number of answers for an assessment per person to consider on average? ex: "only averages that have at least 3 answers per person's evaluation will be calculated. If you have less answers, consider the agreed minimum average as the average of the person's evaluation".

If you decide to link the assessment to Mentoring, Partnership or bonus variation, try a few more items in the agreement:
- every time a person falls below the minimum average, he will be invited to seek advice with the [Contorno Mentoring](#mentoring).
- below average for 2 times in a row, an automatic proposal is made to close a partnership in the contorno [Partnership](#partnership) passing through an integrative decision.
- the global average of the organization's evaluation result will serve as a guide for the bonus variation.
- the % of the difference from the personal average to the global average of the company, will be the variation of the bonus, up or down.

Cautions:
- If you notice that the average of most people is usually low in relation to the organization's principles, ask yourself about the principles and about your understanding of them.

### General evaluation
People will offer subjective reactions to a particular person they collaborate with regarding participation in a particular contorno. We want subjective evaluations so as not to fall into the fiction of a [performance evaluation](https://medium.com/tentaculus/os-perigos-da-avalia%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-desempenho-nas-organiza%C3%A7%C3%B5es-21a92e261fe3) objective.

#### Participation
* if you are evaluating the guardian of a contorno, it will be evaluated by the guardian of the outer contorno and by participants of the contorno you are in as guardian. If the re-evaluated person is the guardian of the organization's largest contorno and the organization has the ["North" contorno](#north), people from that contorno will also be invited.
* if you are evaluating an agent of a contorno, it will be evaluated by the participants of the contorno.
* in both cases: you can invite any other person who has recurring interaction in the organization to participate in the assessment.

#### Process
* Decide which contornos you want reactions to. It is recommended that you do the process one contorno at a time.
* Invite the people listed above.
* Share all contorno attributes and contorno indicator results for which you want to be evaluated and inform which structural role (guardian or agent) is allocated.
* The person being evaluated chooses a person to facilitate the process by following the steps below. The person being evaluated cannot facilitate the process.

#### Stage of understanding
A round is made with the questions below, starting with the self-assessment of the person who wants assessment and then moving on to other people:

* what has the person been doing well while allocated in the contorno?
* what can the person improve while allocated in the contorno?

#### Thermometer stage on allocation
Secretly, ask everyone who is participating in the assessment to register from 1 to 3, without identification, how much they agree with this statement:
- given what I perceive about the person's performance and behavior as [Guardian or Agent] in the assessed contorno, I would like to reassess their allocation as soon as possible. (1–3) - 1 (disagree), 2 (maybe I don't know or don't have an opinion), or 3 (agree).

Only share the note with whoever is facilitating.

#### Exploration stage
Given what was presented in the understanding stage, discover themes and aspects that answer the question:
* what areas for improvement do you see?

People present respond.

It may be something the person is already doing well, but wants to focus more.

#### Allocation decision stage
The average score obtained in the "Allocation Thermometer Internship" is shared with the person being evaluated and other participants.
If the average grade is above 2, then:
* if it is the person's first assessment in this structural role of the contorno or if the last assessment the grade was less than 2:
    * the person is invited to seek counseling with the [Contorno Mentoring](#mentoring).
    * the process moves to the next step.
* if **not** is the person's first assessment of this structural role of the contorno:
  * if the last evaluation the grade was less than or equal to 2:
    * the person is invited to seek counseling with the [Contorno Mentoring](#mentoring).
  * if it is the second consecutive time with a grade greater than 2:
    * if you are a guardian, the process is stopped for a [guardian nomination](#guardian-nomination-in-an-evaluation-process).
    * if she is an agent, she is invited to leave the contorno.

#### Action brainstorming stage
Now, everyone together can brainstorm actions for improvement in the areas listed.

How would people like to see improvements in these areas? Make it specific and doable.

It is an exploration to help the person decide what they want as their own plan of action in the next step.

#### Action plan creation stage

Now, the person being evaluated creates an action plan proposal with the actions they explored in the previous step. She can ask for help from a person who has experience in these contornos or someone she trusts.

This plan can be created during or after the dynamic.

#### Plan decision stage

It is suggested that there is a structural agreement in the contorno of the person being evaluated or at an organizational level stating which of these alternatives will be in effect:

* The person himself can decide for his own action plan.
* Carry out integrative decision with the contorno in which the person works.
* Make an integrative decision with someone from the [Mentorship contorno](#mentoring).

In the next assessment, the person shares their latest action plan and explores what they were able to apply from it.

### Guardian nomination in an evaluation process

Rules:
1. the guardian of the outer contorno conducts the process. If the person being reassessed is the guardian of the organization's highest profile, she nominates someone else to lead the process.
2. secretly, each participant nominates - self-nomination is possible - and orders up to three people as "first", "second" and "third" option taking into account the criteria:
  - ongoing projects in the contorno
  - skills
  - knowing the scope
  - time for dedication
  - integration with the people around
  - preference
3. the process leader scores points referring to the order of options, using [dowdall system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count#Dowdall_system_(Nauru)):
  - for each person as the first option, 1 point is scored.
  - for each person as a second option, 0.5 point is scored.
  - for each person as a third option, 0.33 point is counted.
4. the person with the highest score is proposed and undergoes an integrative decision. Objections must be joined by anyone who has a proposal for integration.
5. if the proposal fails to integrate the objections, step 4 is repeated with the **second** highest-scoring person.
6. if the proposal fails to integrate the objections, step 4 is repeated with the **third** person with the highest score.
7. If a proposal still fails with built-in objections, the person with the highest score is named Guardian.

Comments:
- if the person who was a guardian is not chosen as a guardian in this cycle, he/she becomes an agent of the contorno.


## Progression Track

Instead of starting with an overly complicated and customized track, try to start with something simplified and that anyone will quickly understand.
Over time, you can craft more customized tracks with more requirements at each level. However, assess whether it is really necessary.

**Example of a simple track:**
- **Aspirant**
  - never worked on this contorno (or similar scope) before
  - watch other people in this contorno perform their tasks
  - tasks and process: **advises on what tasks to do and how to do it**
- **Apprentice**
  - has already practiced the basic tasks of this contorno (or similar scope) in various contexts
  - watch other people in this contorno make decisions about their tasks
  - tasks and process: **advises on what tasks to do and finds out how to do it**
- **Experient**
  - maybe minimal experience? years: may vary with contorno
  - proposes solutions
  - tasks and process: **finds out what and how to do it**
- **Specialist**
  - maybe minimal experience? years: may vary with contorno
  - mastery and deepening in ? and ?
  - tasks and process: **finds out what to do in more complicated scopes and advises others who are not experts in those scopes what to do**

### Identification beyond the track
**In addition to the track, it is possible to identify:**
- **newcomers** at the company: participate in the "newcomers" contorno with a duration of 3 months. This can affect salary: deduct a percentage of salary until you pass this 3-month period.
- **mentors** people: participate in the [Mentoring](#mentoring) contorno. This can affect salary: increase of a percentage of salary.

## Recognition with medals

In addition to the progression track, it is possible to have a recognition with medals together.
There can be medals for the organization in general or medals for specific contornos.

**Rules:**
- Each medal contains basic requirements to earn it: proof of knowledge or experience, or previous achievements of other medals.
- People send evidence to receive it.
- Medals are temporary, valid for pre-determined months or years. Once this time ends, the medal is lost and it is necessary to send new evidence to win it.

### New contornos for the medal system

For the medal system to work, it is necessary to create new contornos:
  - **Making organization medals**: creates and adapts medals, with integrative decision.
  - **Made of medals of a specific contour**: creates and adapts medals, with integrative decision.
  - **Evaluation of evidence for organization medals**: evaluates evidence to receive general organization medals.
  - **Evaluation of evidence for medals of a specific contour**: evaluates evidence to receive medals in the specific contour.

## Remuneration and salaries
There are several ways to remunerate collaborating people.

Remuneration can be for:
- fixed pre-defined hours in the contract related or not to the person's main specialty
- hours recorded monthly on demand of work
- projects delivered
- results achieved
- contorno that a person participates in with type of energy ["focus" or "specialty"](#type-of-energy-in-contour)
- level of [progression track](#progression-track)
- [medals](#recognition-with-medals)
- evaluation for [influencing expectations](#influencing-expectations-of-mentoring-partnership-or-bonus-variations), adapting to also vary the salary. Remember to agree this with people in advance
- salary proposed by the person
- or, mix of the above options 


## Selective process
[To be developed]
In the meantime, see [References about selective-process](en/references#references-about-selective-process)

## Combination with other existing processes or technologies
It is possible to combine [Contornos] with the adaptation of other existing processes.

- [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
- [Foco & Fôlego](https://medium.com/tentaculus/processo-foco-f-c3-b4lego-updated-60c6468160c)
