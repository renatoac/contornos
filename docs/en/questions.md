# Questions & Answers

## How to get started with the Contornos system?

### How to make the decision to use the system?
Below are possibilities, not exhaustive. Don't see this as something right, easy or universal, but rather as an alternative focused on making intentions and motivations explicit and engaging people.

Do not try to speed up use of the system before seeking a shared understanding of the motivation for using the [Contornos] system and how it works, and before talking about people's concerns, and acknowledging them.

In order for the decision to use the system to be lasting and maximize the desired benefits, people's engagement is important.

#### Steps to 'Implement'
1. Invite the desired audience: see the topics below for some options.
2. Share about the [Contornos] system with this audience, the motivation to use it, and hold a session with space for discussion, questions and answers.
3. Make [an integrative decision proposal](apps#process-for-decis-proposals%C3%B5es-integrative) to use [Contornos] in this audience.
4. Talk about what changes responsibilities and authority from the person who was 'boss' or 'leader' of the team, and now becomes Guardian, and what the responsibilities of the structural role of Agent are. Remember that being in a structural Guardian role is no longer related to any hierarchical level, title, or role stability, as other people may be assigned as Guardians later.
5. Do a mapping [inside guest audience contornos](questions#how-to-map-first-contornos) in step 1.
6. If any contorno is of a scope for which there was no responsible person, define who will be the Guardian of that contorno through an integrative decision, if there was already someone responsible for the scope, assume that person as the Contorno Guardian.
7. Start using the Contornos system on this contorno. Make use of [boosters](contornos#boosters), distribution of operational decisions and integrative decisions to adapt the structure and agreements.
8. After 1 week, do a small group discussion of the experiment. Suggestion: [world-cafe](http://www.theworldcafe.com/key-concepts-resources/world-cafe-method/). The result can be, in addition to reflections and shared understanding, new [boosters](contornos#boosters) and new agreements with integrative decision.
9. Repeat step 8, but now, every 15 days, until you reach 3 months of experiment.
10. In each dynamic, and in some official channel of the public involved, share evidence and metrics of the experiment with the [Contornos] system.
10. From then on the experiment becomes standard practice and can continue to be adapted at any time through [boosters](contornos#boosters).

### What are the ways to get started with the system?

#### Current drawing
It can start with the current drawing, explaining the existing scopes in contornos, in addition to their attributes, and also agreements.
From that point on, the organization begins to adapt by having a system prepared for this.

#### New draw
You can start with a new organizational design.

### Where to start?
#### At the highest hierarchical level in the organization
It is possible to start [Contornos] directly at the highest hierarchical level of the organization.
1. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy) with this group only.
2. If you want other groups in the organization to use the system, share the experience - failures, successes, challenges, and benefits - with the entire organization.
3. Invite subgroups to experiment. Subgroups that show interest, follow the [steps to 'implement'](#steps-to-implement).
4. Share the experience of these subgroups with the organization;
5. Go back to step 3.
6. At some point, decide if you want to deploy to [entire-organization](#in-entire-organization).

#### In a spin-off (new structure derived from the main structure)
It is possible to start [Contornos] in a new structure derived from the main structure of the organization.
1. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy) with this group only.
2. Continue inviting groups and people from the main structure and structuring new contornos in that derigavem, replacing the scope in the main structure, until the new structure becomes the main structure.

#### In a local group
If you only want to deploy to a local group in your organization:
1. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy) in this local group only.
2. If the group currently has sub-times and want to use the system in them, follow the steps in the topic on how to implement in [whole-organization](#in-whole-organization), but focus only on the current group inside, in sub-times.

Below are some possibilities for local groups.

* **groups serving external audiences**
1. Obtain approval from the person at the highest level of leadership in the hierarchy.
2. Invite a team that has the most direct contact with the external audience: customer service, product development, sales, etc.
3. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy).
4. After a while of practice, start using the system on the direct inner contornos.
5. Unfold to other inner contornos.
6. Start with other areas of the organization.

* **groups that serve the internal public**
1. Obtain approval from the person at the highest level of leadership in the hierarchy.
2. Invite a team that serves internal people and teams.
3. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy).
4. After a while of practice, start using the system on the direct inner contornos.
5. Unfold to other inner contornos.
6. Start with other areas of the organization.

#### Organization-wide: everyone on board about what's going to happen and 80% confirming next step
If you want to 'implement' in advance across the organization in an inviting way and have an agreement, you can try the steps below.

1. Obtain approval from the person at the highest level of leadership in the hierarchy.
2. Invite the highest layer in the hierarchy.
3. Follow the [steps to 'deploy'](#steps-to-deploy) with this group.
4. If they decide to go forward, share the [Contornos] system with everyone in the organization, stating the motivation. Allow time to study and write down questions and concerns.
5. Hold a session with space for questions and answers.
   - Ask them to discuss risks and concerns, and how to mitigate them, and possible benefits and how this would help with current challenges.
   - Remind them that it won't be easy or quick if they start with the [Contornos] system. Also remember that changes applied to an entire organization are not easy, and that's why it's important to have people on board. Having a shared understanding of the context and motivations for the new system is important.
   - Remind them that "leadership" positions will change, with restriction of authority, no longer having power over people, however, the intention is that people in these current positions can still help the organization as guardians of the scopes they already serve.
   - Advise them what the steps will be to start the new system, how they will identify if the experiment is going down a path they believe or is making the organization worse, and what will make the organization give up and go back.
   - Inform how they will share evidence and metrics about the progress of the experiment with the [Contornos] system.
   - Decide whether they want to provide an opportunity for people who want to leave with the system change. Example of possible opportunity: offering X salary(s) more if they resign, in addition to support for relocation in the labor market - but without guarantee.
   - At the end of the session:
     - share patterns you found about the concerns, fears and challenges people reported. Recognizing this is important. Also share what were discussed ways to mitigate the risks and address these concerns.
     - share the patterns found about what motivates people to change and what benefits they envision. This can engage people who had doubts or thought the change would not be important, but realizing the possible benefits, may now desire change.
6. Advise that there will be a round of voting, that implementation will only go forward if 80% or more of people vote in favour, and that people who vote against will still be included in discussions to help mitigate risks and concerns.
7. Define when the survey will be sent and through which official channel of the organization.
8. Send a "yes" or "no" poll to everyone in the organization and ask, "Do you support the implementation of the [Contornos] system?"
9. Share the result across the organization.

| If approval equal to or above 80% in the second round | If not approved by at least 80% of people |
| --- | --- |
| 10. Celebrate with the entire organization an important step they will take. Remember that it won't be easy or fast, but it will be possible with people's support.<br />11. Acknowledge the concerns of people who voted "no" in the second round and did not opt ​​out, and say that they will be included in the feedback process.<br />12. Create an "Organizational System" contorno.<br />13. Determine who will be the guardian of the "Organizational System" contorno for the 3-month period. After that, make a new naming process.<br />14. Ask people who had voted "no" and wish to identify themselves to choose 2 delegates.<br /> - delegates will be consulted periodically to help mitigate risks in the first 3 months, bring their views and even help to do so the role of devil's advocate in discussions about the progress of the experiment with the new system. <br /> - add the 2 delegates as agents of the new contorno. Make an agreement that this participation will only be for 3 months.<br />15. Ask the Guardian to nominate 3 more people to be agents of this contorno. <br />16. From here the evolution of the experiment with the Contornos system is coordinated by the contorno "Organizational System".<br /> 17. Follow the [steps to 'implement'](#steps-to-implement), this time in the entire organization. | 10. Celebrate with the entire organization a decision not to follow through because they managed to do so involving the entire organization. <br />11. Decide whether to start the system only in a [local-group](#in-a-local-group) (see [here](#in-a-local-group)). <br />12. Advise the organization that the experiment will be carried out in local groups. And if other groups wish, they are invited too. |

### How to map and split the contornos?
#### Options - combine them according to need and context
- For product/service:
   - by **intentions**(*) of the audience that the organization serves
   - by **stages of the journey** of the person when carrying out an intention(*)
   - by **strategies** of the larger product/service contorno
     - examples: "Custom content per member"; "Members connected to at least one other member on the platform"; "Products found on first search attempt"; etc)
     - that is, create specialized contornos for each strategy of the larger product contorno.
   - by sides or **actors of a marketplace** 
   - based on **complexity** of scopes
   - based on **dependence** between scopes
   - based on **modularization** of technological services
   - etc

It is possible to make combinations depending on the level of abstraction, with stable and/or temporary teams.
**Examples:** stable contornos by **intentions**, having temporary inner contornos for **bets on initiatives**. Or, stable contornos by **marketplace actors** with stable inner contornos by marketplace actor **intentions**. 

- General:
   - ["Organizational Network Analysis"](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/articles/organizational-network-analysis.html) and look at the kind of connections that currently exist.
   - Mapping [process and value stream](#refer%C3%AAncias-over-process-mapping) of the larger contorno in relation to the organization's reason for existence.
   - Mapping of activities that people currently perform and [convert to responsibilities](#defini%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-responsibilities). After that, define the contornos and all their attributes.

_(*)Intention can be understood as a Jobs To Be Done job, purpose of Fit For Purpose, by "tower" or "mental space" from Indi Young's Mental Model diagram, etc._ 
If interested, refer to materials such as [Team Topologies](https://www.amazon.com/Team-Topologies-Organizing-Business-Technology-ebook/dp/B07NSF94PC), [Fit For Purpose](https://www. amazon.com/Fit-Purpose-Businesses-Satisfy-Customers/dp/0985305118) and [Jobs To Be Done](https://medium.com/tentaculus/jobs-to-be-done-parte-1-42bfdf4875c8) ._


### Example of contornos structure
Any pre-fabricated model about team design is flawed by nature precisely because it does not reflect or adapt to reality. However, some can be useful for inspiring and starting experiments.

There are numerous possibilities. There is no cake recipe or something universal.

For illustrative purposes, the possibility below shows a mixture of contornos of support for the organization as a whole with contornos by intention (see above) of the public that the business serves delimited within the contorno of products/services, also having contornos of specialization internally.

It is possible several other alternatives, for example, some contornos of the example below that are within product/service - customer service, sales & marketing, research, etc - could be within each intention contorno, if it is useful and more efficient, depending on the scale of the organization and product/service.

Example:
- Organizational System
  - Organizational Design & Service Design
- Care & Counseling
  - Mediation of conflicts
  - Counseling & Mentoring
  - listen
- [Partnership maintenance](apps#contorno-manuten%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-partnership)
- Financial
- Product or Service A (example: "Technology-related subjects teaching platform")
  - Service
  - Sales and Marketing
  - Research
  - Contents
  - Partnerships
  - Customer Intent A (example: "Get your first job in the technology area or make a career transition")
    - Modeling of initiatives
    - Design of the product/service experience
    - Development
      - Graphic/physical interface
      - Implementation
  - Customer Intent B (example: "To undertake in the technology area")
    - [internal contornos]
  - Customer Intent C (example: "Connecting with professionals in the technology job market")
    - [internal contornos]

## How to measure the impact of organizational design changes?
In a simplistic and limited way, it is possible to try to compare before and after:
- the level of people's engagement
  - example alternative: 8 questions from [Engagement Pulse](https://www.tmbc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IN0092_Engagement_Pulse_white_paper_r02v01.pdf)
- how much the organization is meeting the needs of the public, which makes sense for the business, with the products and services offered
  - example alternative: search as [Fit For Purpose](https://www.amazon.com/Fit-Purpose-Businesses-Satisfy-Customers-ebook/dp/B078JFTVS8/)
- the patterns of organizational tensions: are they changing?
  - alternative as an example: use the [Mapa Tentaculus](https://medium.com/tentaculus/mapear-oportunidades-organizacoes-ad66f1b9a913) or the [OS Canvas](https://medium.com/the-ready/the -operating-system-canvas-420b8b4df062), asking for each aspect what has worked well and what has not.

## How to define the responsibilities of an contorno?
- Don't put behavioral expectations into responsibilities. For that see about [personal agreements](contornos#personal-agreements).
- Avoid responsibilities that are expected of anyone in the organization.
- Start with infinitive verb: Correct, Define, Realize, etc.
- Explain and specify what is ambiguous
- In the responsibility, describe what is the **active** participation in an activity.

**Avoid these verbs:**
* Approve → do not use this verb or expect this kind of responsibility. Responsibilities do not limit other contornos. If you want to limit the type of interaction with any organizational artifact, then use [exclusive control features](contornos#exclusive-control-features-like), [process](contornos#process-like) or [agreements structural](contornos#structural-agreements).
* Align → Alignment is ambiguous. What is expected with the alignment? Advise or advise someone? Consult? Share information?
* Collaborate / Reply to people (or messages from people) → they are already expected to collaborate and communicate. What else is specifically expected in the collaboration?
* Guarantee / Insure → instead spell out how you want to guarantee or insure something to get something more specific and practical?
* Meet → find out what the meeting wants to resolve or decide and what specific responsibilities are there.
* Manage people → responsibilities cannot provide this kind of authority and power. What do you want with manage? Advise, mentor, train? See more about [special contornos in Apps](apps#special-contornos).

## Do people need to have prior maturity to work in such a system?
This question generally comes from at least two premises of the questioner:
1. related to maturity: people need to be 'ready' or 'mature' for something, before practicing it.
   - comments:
     - if we don't allow people to practice and experiment, it's difficult to reach some maturity, whatever it means in your context. Anyway, I don't believe maturity is magic, but experience. And you can only gain experience by practicing.
2. related to decision making that does not depend on bosses: people need someone, in a paternalistic role, to make decisions for them.
   - comments:
     - People already make several decisions in their lives: who to relate to, which house or car to buy (and whether they want to buy), join or leave a company, how to eat, etc. We can re-include them in decisions that affect their work and life.
     - As mentioned above, it is important to remember that there are still people who do not want to take responsibility for the decision, prefer to outsource decisions that impact its scope and have less accountability for it. So, it's a decision they'll have to make: which person's profile do we want?
     - and like any other system, game and rules, not all people will prefer it or want to support that system. Here is a [decision on how to move forward](questions#how-to-start-with-the-contorno-system).

## How to hire people who want the title and power of boss, director, leader or C-level?
- First, ask yourselves: do you want people in search of titles or people willing and engaged in solving the challenges of a given scope?
- Second, instead of trying to give that person a title or concentrated power, share with them about:
  - for which contorno they are doing the selection process
  - what are the contorno responsibilities and the challenges
  - how the [Contornos] system works in a simplified way
  - what are the responsibilities of the Guardian structural role, in which it will be allocated
  - what power restrictions of the Guardian role
  - which contorno and organization agreements

## What to do if we want to make all the decisions of an contorno in an integrative way?
Create a structural agreement on the contorno, stating that all decisions will be made in an integrative way among the contorno participants.

## What do I do if I feel insecure about making a decision, even though the contorno I participate in has the authority to make the decision?
At any time, you can seek advice from people who seem to be knowledgeable about the subject or who are most engaged with the subject.

Read about [boosters](contornos#boosters).

## What to do with endless discussions, whether synchronous - in live meetings - or asynchronous - by digital tools?

When an argument starts to stretch without seeming to get anywhere, ask what you want to resolve and which contorno has more specific responsibility for it.

1. If there is a contorno that already takes care of the issue: forward it to the guardian of the contorno. If anyone is still willing to talk about it, ask to speak with the guardian.
2. If there is no contorno that already takes care of the issue: forward it to the guardian of the scope closest to the subject or the broader scope that can cover this subject.
