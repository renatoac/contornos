  - When it is necessary to decide on more than one person, decide on a few people who represent the scopes impacted.
  - People who participate in the decisions are also impacted by the decisions.
  - Consider input from impacted people who do not participate in decisions before making decisions.
  - Gather reactions from impacted people who do not participate in decisions after making decisions.
- :loudspeaker: Make information available and understandable to all people who need or can benefit from that information.
