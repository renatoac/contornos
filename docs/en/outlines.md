# Principles
- :cyclone: Take into account the organizational system as a whole and the value streams.
- :loop: Amplify 'feedback loops'.
- :zap: Experiment and learn continuously. 
- :high_brightness: Decentralize decisions. 
  - When it is necessary to decide on more than one person, decide on a few people who represent the scopes impacted.
  - People who participate in the decisions are also impacted by the decisions.
  - Consider input from impacted people who do not participate in decisions before making decisions.
  - Gather reactions from impacted people who do not participate in decisions after making decisions.
- :loudspeaker: Make information available and understandable to all people who need or can benefit from that information.
- :thumbsup: Everything is allowed as long as it is not explicitly forbidden.

# Organizational structure
The organizational structure is defined by outlines. The people in the organization work guided by these outlines, a hierarchy of specificity, not of people. 

The system starts with the maxim that _"everything is allowed as long as it is not explicitly forbidden"_ in some [agreement](#agreements) containing restriction or defined as [resources o exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) of some outline instead of the common inverse in many organizations that _"everything is forbidden as long as it is explicitly allowed"_. 

[See an example of a outline structure in the Questions & Answers](questions#example-of-outline-structure).

# Outlines
A outline is a scope delimited by reason for existence, responsibilities, resources of exclusive control, and proper agreements.
Having a defined outline avoids deciding all the time what needs to be done and who will do something.

Each outline governs its own structure, which can be changed by the outline guardian or by integrative decision depending on the context.

One person can be on several outlines, and one outline can contain several people.

## When to create new outlines?

Create outlines when you notice some recurring patterns to leverage effectiveness and shared understanding or when you want to delegate some of the responsibilities and resources of exclusive control. [In Questions & Answers, see options that may help in mapping new outlines](questions#how-to-map-and-divide-the-outlines).

Examples demonstrating contexts for outline creation: 
- Recurrently the outline you participate needs to perform data analysis in a more advanced way. For a while the participants were trying to help each other, each time doing something, but it was not explicit who had this responsibility and what other responsibilities there might be. Then, because of this recurrence, someone registers a [booster](#boosters) for the outline with a proposal to create an internal "data analysis" outline, making explicit what is expected. And then they make a proposal to allocate one person as guardian of this outline. From then on they will no longer need to decide who will do this kind of work and what responsibilities are expected. 
- A "Tech" outline has the responsibility to take care of the infrastructure and deployment process of some systems that the outline develops. However, this started to create conflicts and doubts about which participants would have to have the skills, knowledge and attention for this. Then, one participant created a [booster](#boosters) with a proposal to create an internal "Platform" outline delegating the "deployment process" as a resource of exclusive control of this new outline and also the responsibilities to take care of the infrastructure and process. And then they allocated one person as [guardian](#guardi%c3%a3-of-outline) of the outline and another with [agent](#agent-of-outline).  


**Rules**:
- Draw new outlines based on the demands of the public, internal or external.
- minimize the creation of outlines that depend on recurrent, planned and necessary deliveries (_handover_ or _handoff_) of other outlines that are not within the same external outline. Encourage the participants of the outlines that have dependence to have a close context in common - an external outline, favoring that they participate in meetings, decisions and treatment of [drivers](#drivers) together.
  - example of dependency in a different context and in the same context
    - ![Image exemplifying Handover or Handoff](./assets/handoffhandover.png ':size=480')
  - if a dependency between outlines that are in different external outlines is desired or necessary, it is recommended to create a structural role of [representative](apps#representing-structural-paper) so that the outlines have some connection.
 

## How to adapt or remove an outline?
Anytime someone perceives that a outline needs, or is desirable, to be adapted, whatever the attribute, or that it no longer has a reason to exist, a proposal can be made to carry out this alteration or removal of the outline.

To remove a outline, an integrative decision by the external outline is necessary, being able to decide which outlines internal to the outline being deleted they want to bring to the outline that is making the decision.

To adapt the outline, it is necessary to identify which [attribute](outlines#outline-attributes) you want to change and who has the authority to adapt it.

# Participation in outlines
Participation in outlines happens through the allocation of people. It is possible to indicate the [type of energy](apps#type-of-energy-in-outline) that each participant will have in a certain outline.

Any participant in an outline has these **common responsibilities**:
* perceive and treat [boosters](#boosters) of its outline.
* prioritize projects and tasks according to the reason for existing and the strategy of the outlines in which it participates.
* share any information related to your outline ー projects, tasks, etc ー when someone asks, unless something is agreed to be confidential.
* perform whatever is necessary to express the reason for existing and the strategy of the outlines in which it participates, respecting [agreements](#agreements), [strategy](#strateg%C3%A9gia-how), [process](#process- as) and [resources of exclusive control]#resources-of-exclusive-control-how).
* and, when necessary, carry out the above responsibility also for the outlines that **does not** participate, taking into account these rules:
  * consider the context and available information of the current structure and the risk or opportunity.
  * make the best judgment possible with what you have at your disposal.
  * perform the actions you deem appropriate and necessary.
  * notify participants of this outline.

## Structural Papers
There are only two basic structural roles in Outlines: guardian and agent.

In addition to these two structural roles, it is possible to install [extra structural roles](apps#pap%C3%A9is-structural-extras), such as: [Representative](apps#representing-structural-paper), [Synapse](apps #synapse-structural-paper), [Facilitator](apps#facilitator-structural-paper) and [Secretary](apps#secret-structural-paper%c3%a1ria).

### Guardian

#### Reason for existing
  * keep the outline space and answer for its reason for existing.

#### Participation
  * every guardian of a outline is also a participant in the outer outline as [agent](#agent).

#### Responsibilities
  * _all general responsibilities of outline participants_.
  * _all own outline responsibilities_ that are not delegated to internal outlines.
  * bring information from the external outline to all participants of your outline.
  * act on [boosters](outlines#boosters) without progress in its outline.
  * to propose a outline strategy, requiring an integrative decision.
  * to propose a outline process, needing an integrative decision.
  * propose people to support the outline.
  * take action on direct internal outlines without participants: invite people to them or remove the outline, with integrative decision.
  * share indicators with the outer outline, at the frequency suggested by the outer outline.
  * share on the progress of projects with the external outline, at the frequency suggested by the external outline, stating how this connects to the strategy and purpose of the external outline.

#### Responsibilities of the guardian of the greatest outline, the organization itself
  * _all general responsibilities of outline participants_.
  * _all own outline responsibilities_ that are not delegated to internal outlines.
  * act on [boosters](outlines#boosters) without progress in its outline.
  * to propose a outline strategy, requiring an integrative decision.
  * to propose a outline process, needing an integrative decision.
  * propose people to support the outline.
  * take action on direct internal outlines without participants: invite people to them or remove the outline, with integrative decision.
  * share indicators with the organization, at the frequency defined with participants of the highest profile.
  * share about the progress of the projects with the organization, at the frequency defined with participants of the highest profile.

----

#### Adaptation of the Guardian structural role
It is possible to delegate Guardian responsibilities to other internal outlines by integrative decision and recorded as "Delegated Guardian structural role" so that when you are in the removal process, remember to redeem the responsibility for the Guardian structural role.

#### Guardian structural role restrictions
The guardian has no authority to:
  * add new responsibilities to your role.
  * hire new people into the organization or fire people.
    * to solve both cases there may be a [special outline](apps#special-outlines) for this or a [structural agreement](#structural-agreements) that determines how hiring and firing will be done. But this is not a responsibility of the structural Guardian role, nor is it in its authority.
  * micromanage or violate other outline agreements or exclusive control features, including internal outlines.
  * require **exclusive** detailed reporting from someone about tasks.
    * if someone's intention, including those in the structural guardian role, is to have updates, specifics, or projections of something on demand, they can ask these questions of anyone directly.
    * if the outline so desires, it is possible to create a structural agreement about group sharing rituals, either in meetings or through some tool, determining the frequency to be performed.

### Agent

#### Reason for existing
  * evolve the outline towards the reason for existing.

#### Participation
  * if the agent is not also the guardian of some internal outline, its participation is restricted to the outline as an agent.
  * if the agent is also the guardian of some internal outline, its participation happens both in the outline as agent and in the outline as guardian.

#### Responsibilities
  * _all general outline participant responsibilities_.
  * _all own outline responsibilities_ that are not delegated to internal outlines.

## Allocation of people in outlines
To be able to be allocated in any way, a person must be a partner of the organization, whatever the form: hired collaborator, partner or other agreed form. And to become a partner, it is expected that there is some outline with this responsibility, such as the [Partnership Maintenance special outline](apps#contorno-manuten%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-partnership).

After becoming a partner, people can be dynamically allocated to outlines over time.

The allocation of people differs depending on the structural role that will be played in the outline.

When the revaluation period arrives, or when any outline participant creates a booster with this order, it is necessary to carry out a [revaluation](#revaluation%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-aloca%C3%A7%C3%A3o ).

### Guardian and agent allocation
#### Guardian
A guardian for a new inner outline is appointed by integrative decision by all participants of the **external** outline.
 
#### Agent
To allocate new agents in the outline, the guardian makes a proposal or asks for a [nomination process] (apps#namea%C3%A7%C3%A3o-of-people-for-a-outline), requiring an integrative decision between participants of the outline.

Anyone can apply as an agent of a outline at any time, taking the matter to the guardian of the outline. The guardian of the outline can deny the request or bring the outline to an integrative decision, if it considers the person's inclusion.

Also, anyone can appoint a person to the structural role of agent and make an integrative decision.

### Beware of focus and time
Before making an allocation proposal to a new outline, ask yourself:
- How many hours do you want to be invested in this outline? and how often?

When making an integrative decision of [naming](apps#namea%C3%A7%C3%A3o-of-people-to-a-outline), question yourself as an objection enhancer:
- does the person have the time and focus necessary for this other outline? It is indicated that the person himself also assess for possible objection if he is with cognitive overload to be in many different contexts that require routine activities.

### Allocation revaluation
When allocating a person to a outline, it is necessary to define the frequency of revaluation of this allocation.
Guardians and agents will have their participation [evaluated periodically] (apps#evaluation-in-a-outline), according to the definition of frequency, in the outlines in which they participate.

It is recommended to use the [Appraisal in an outline](apps#appraisal-in-a-outline).

### Withdrawal of people from outlines
Anyone can opt out of a outline by notifying the participants of the outline in advance.
And anyone can suggest that a person is removed from a outline, however, in this case, needing an integrative decision in it.

Withdrawing from an outline is different from terminating a partnership contract with the organization. It just means that the person will come out of an outline.

If a person no longer participates in any other outline or is in outlines that do not use the agreed time to hire the person, they must take this issue to a outline that has responsibility for allocating people throughout the organization, such as [Special Advice outline of Allocation](apps#outline-advice-of-allocation%C3%A7%C3%A3o).
Or, if the intention is to end the partnership, take the issue directly to an outline responsible for this scope, such as the [Partnership Maintenance special outline](apps#contorno-manuten%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-partnership) .

If these special outlines do not exist, the case should be taken to the larger outline of the organization, asking to know about outlines that it could participate in or, if it is her intention, asking to end the partnership.

# Outline attributes
Each outline has a list of attributes. Several of the attributes listed below are connected by the 'Why' questions will we do something? -> 'How' will we do something? -> 'What' will we do?.

Rule:
- for any change of attribute of a outline it is necessary to notify its external outline and internal outlines.

## Surname and Scope

### Surname
This attribute is intended to uniquely identify the outline, and therefore cannot have its name repeated by more than one outline.
Any nickname can be used, from real names to invented names.

The definition of the outline nickname is determined by the participants of the outline itself in an integrative decision.

### Scope
This attribute allows you to quickly understand the scope of the outline. This attribute is not to uniquely identify the outline, but to represent what the scope of the outline is. Examples of names: Product, Development, Design, Finance, etc.
It is possible and even expected that there will be repeated scopes throughout the organization.

The definition of the scope name is determined by the external outline in an integrative decision.

### How to uniquely identify an outline?
Suppose we want to cite a "frontend" scope loop in an organization that already has several other "frontend" scope loops.

To uniquely identify, we could:
  * use the [nickname](#nickname) attribute that the outline defined.
    * example: ```Frontend XYZ Javascript Masters```.
  * use [hierarchy annotation](curiosities#about-the-note%C3%A7%C3%Hierarchy-to-identify%C3%A7%C3%C3%A3o-of-outline) with the scopes of the outlines.
    * To use this annotation format, start with the name of the largest outline in the organization and move to the current outline using the "." (dot) as a connector.
      * for example, if you want to quote the "frontend" outline, which is inside the "implementation" outline, which is inside the "XYZ product" outline, and which ultimately is inside the "ABC organization", you can use the note:
        * ```ABC organization.XYZ product.implementation.frontend```.

## Reason for existing (’Why?’)
The reason for existing tells why a outline exists. The outlines are aligned and nested by it.

Rules:
* the statement must be made from the perspective that the outline meets and, preferably, measurable. In the case of the largest outline, the organization, the statement of the reason for existing must be made from the perspective of the audience that the organization serves. In the case of other outlines, they can be from the external or internal audience, depending on the outline.
* avoid amplified words or unattainable aspirations that hinder comprehension and cannot be measured.
* it is decided by the external outline through integrative decision.

## Responsibilities (’How?’)
[Responsibilities](questions#how-to-define-a-outline-responsibilities) are expectations agreements about the main recurring actions that the people of a outline will take care of. They make explicit any things that are not easily deduced from reading the reason for existing.

People have the authority to act and do whatever is necessary to express the reason for the existence of an outline, even if something is not listed in the responsibilities, without the need for approval from other people outside their outline, and it is necessary to respect [agreements] (#agreements), [strategy](#strateg%C3%A9gia-how), [process](#process-how) and [resources of exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) of other outlines .

It is important to know that, intentionally, the responsibilities **do not prevent other outlines from doing something described in the responsibilities**.
To prevent this from happening it is necessary to create a structural [agreement](#agreements) that prevents other outlines from doing anything or assign [resource of exclusive control](#resources-of-exclusive-control-how) to the outline itself.

The responsibilities of a outline are decided by the external outline through integrative decision.

### Operational decisions
They are situational decisions, not foreseen and defined in agreements, strategy and process, and which are within the scope of reason to exist and responsibilities of some kind.

![Operating decisions](assets/decisions.png)

If an operational decision of a outline:
- It is safe, whether reversible or irreversible, the outline participant makes the decision, without the need to consult other people. Outline participants already have the authority to decide. **Most decisions will likely fit here. The idea of ​​the [Outlines] system is precisely to distribute decisions and authority.**
- It is risky and reversible, it is recommended that the outline participant consults with more people, but still has authority over the decision. That is, she doesn't need to try to please, adapt or justify her decision. The intention is for her to have more knowledge and perspective on the subject and context before making a decision.
- It is irreversible and risky, it is recommended that the outline participant makes an [integrative decision](#integrative-decisions) with the other outline participants.

We evolved to make decisions very quickly based on a partial data scan, favoring our most recent or most memorable experiences [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule), [ 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias), [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)]. Therefore, the intention is to minimize our biases and increase the data to make better decisions in certain contexts, as suggested above.

## Strategy (’How?’)
A strategy is an explicit statement of outline safety guidelines or outlines that facilitate decision making, prioritization, and outline-reasoning experiments and that aligns with the current external outline strategy.

It is possible to contain [recurring rules, disclaimers or practices (checklist)](references#refer%C3%AAncias-sobre-estrat%C3%A9gias).

The strategy is proposed by the outline guardian, **aligned with the external outline strategy** and defined in [integrative decision](#decis%C3%A3o-integrative) in the outline itself.

When a strategy is changed, it is necessary to review the indicators so that, in addition to bringing information related to the reason for the existence of the outline, they can also contemplate the new strategy. Furthermore, it is necessary to notify the external outline.

From there, prioritize projects that are aligned with the new strategy.

## Process (’How?’)
![process](assets/process.png)

Outlines that have demand processing with expected steps to follow, must specify as [process](references#refer%C3%AAncias-about-process-mapping).
A process is nothing more than a structural agreement, which is why it needs an integrative decision. However, it is an attribute of the outline.

Understanding the demands and steps will help to know what kind of other internal outlines will be needed to deliver the work and deliver the result.

The process must be done from the perspective of demand and the value delivered - whoever asks for, needs or will receive the result of the work, with the intention of minimizing ambiguity and waste, aligning expectations, minimizing decision fatigue and maintaining the level of quality, making explicit recurrent, planned and necessary deliveries (_handover_ or _handoff_), identifying how the outlines interact and which are responsible for the steps and actions.

Rules:
* process mapping is the responsibility of the guardian, consulting people involved in the process.
* [integrative decision](#decis%C3%A3o-integrative) is required to use it in the outline.
* capture all the necessary steps in a flow without getting to the level of predicting small tasks.
* start with the question: what is the first thing that is done or needs to be done when a demand arrives? And then ask: what's the next thing? Continue with this question until you answer the question: What needs to be completed to deliver the result?

## Exclusive Control Features (’How?’)
Each outline can have resources (material, digital or conceptual) of exclusive control. Anyone from another outline wishing to manipulate this feature will need to ask for the desired action from the outline's participants who have exclusive control.

The inner outlines inherit the exclusive control features of the outer outline.

It is important to remember that no one person in the organization has control over the resources, but the very outline in which it belongs. If at any point she leaves the outline, she loses exclusive control of the resource.

For some outline to have exclusive control over some feature it is necessary [integrative decision](#decis%C3%A3o-integrative) by the external outline.

If a outline has exclusive control over the organization's resources as a whole (eg, hiring process or official tools), it can make decisions without the need for an integrative decision on the impacted outlines. However, it is recommended to ask for reactions about possible changes when something impacts too many outlines or when there is a great risk.

Simple rule:
- encourage the resources of exclusive control to belong to the outlines that have the responsibilities of caring for and using the resources.

## Projects (’What?’)
It is suggested that every outline has its own project board where it can give visibility to the progress of its projects.

Projects have frequency of sharing over update defined by the outer outline. The project outline guardian shares the main points of progress, as well as referencing how this connects to the outer circle strategy.

Projects and tasks are the “what” that connects with the “how” ーstrategy + responsibilities + sole control ー that connects with the “why” ー reason to exist.

### Request for projects or tasks

Rules:
* Anyone in the organization can create a [booster](#boosters) to ask for projects or tasks to the outline guardian responsible for a given scope.
* The trigger containing the Project or task request necessarily needs to contain the motivation and context, so that the guardian acting on the Project or task can more deeply understand and connect with the request.
* It is not necessary to ask if the person wants, has the time or thinks it is important, nor to worry if you are bothering when placing an order. The outline already foresees these responsibilities. The person who is the guardian is in that role to serve. She's not doing you a favor, but just the combined work.
* The outline guardian who receives the order will seek to better understand the need and whether this is within the scope of your outline.
* The guardian of the outline for which the request was made has the authority to prioritize the project or task as it suits her, **taking into account the outline strategy**, not having the duty to prioritize by the will or discretion of a external person. At the same time, it is expected that there is negotiation and influence between people on these aspects.
* The guardian does not have the duty to give or inform any specific delivery date, but, if asked, only a projection, as the prioritization of projects and tasks is dynamic, depending on the context. An exception may exist if the guardian herself agrees something with a specific delivery date or if there is some structural agreement that defines a different process.

Question that the guardian can ask the person who made the request:
- What do you need?

Questions the guardian can ask herself:
- Is this within an outline that I'm part of ー reason for existing, responsibilities or resources of exclusive control? Which?
  - If so, the guardian will record the project or task in a list, accessible to others.
    - If she has any objection to the request, she must deal with the person who asked to try to integrate the objection and finally agree on whether or not it will be carried out.
  - If not, the guardian asks herself and the other person:
    - What outline currently has this scope?
      - If there is a responsible outline, the person who made the order must take you to this outline.
      - Otherwise, the person who created the order themselves can try to process the order trigger and/or invite people they deem important to help resolve the trigger.

## Agreements
Agreements are intentional limits that leverage value creation and guide future decisions and actions.
At the same time, the more agreements and the more specifics, the tendency is to have less flexibility, autonomy and space to adapt the structure fluidly and people flourish.

The [Outlines] system itself is an agreement for the development of the organizational structure.
However, from then onwards, new agreements may be necessary.

There are two types of agreements: structural and personal. Both can be adapted, and any participant in the outline can suggest a modification proposal.
