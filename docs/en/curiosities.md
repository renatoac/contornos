# Curiosities

## About the principles
The first three principles were inspired by the [Three Ways (DevOps)](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/).

## Where did the name Guardian come from?
It was inspired by a commentary by author Michelle Holliday about the guardians of the Temple of Transition recorded in this short 7-minute documentary: [DEAR GUARDIANS — A Burning Man Short Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rdqven5MZI ).

> “‘The Guardian is a role’, explains filmmaker Ian MacKenzie. 'Living cultures around the world have known the importance of Guardians — those who provide the space for rituals and rites of passage, for death and the welcome of new life.' when people start filling it with their pain and their love, it then becomes a temple.'” (page 166)

Learn more about the author's book in the article in portuguese [Enxergando organizações como sistemas vivos](https://medium.com/tentaculus/organizacoes-como-sistemas-vivos-80d36e1011f3).

In addition to this curiosity about the source of inspiration, I used the name 'Guardian' to try to minimize hierarchy bias. Keeping an outline, a scope or a space, I believe prevents any possibility from looking like a 'boss' or someone 'above'. The relationship of being a guardian is with some outline and not with some person.

## Where did the idea for [Synapse structural role](apps#synapse-structural-paper) come from?
The idea of drawing people was inspired by the [Wisdom Council](https://www.wisedemocracy.org/3-wisdom-council-process.html) process.

## About Hierarchy Annotation for Outline Identification
The [hierarchy](outlines#scope) of scopes used to identify an outline in a unique way was inspired by [namespace](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espa%C3%A7o_de_nomes), a concept used in several programming languages.

## Language in the female
Throughout the [Outlines] system, I sought to use female language as a socializing agent of gender, in order to avoid that, using male language, there was an interpretation of discrimination based on sex.

If you notice any passage in the male, please notify me.

## Neutral language enhanced, whether in gender or hierarchy
By using only outlines, and two structural roles, rather than multiple operational roles, I also tried to influence the system itself to lean towards using language-neutral scope names.

Comparative examples, if the system used operational roles instead of outlines:

| What you could find as operational role name in some organizations  | How would it possibly be called in Outlines | Outline structural role
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Product Manager | Product | Guardian<br />[of Product] |
| Service Master | Customer Service | Guardian<br />[of Attendance] |
| Doctor of Marketing | Marketing | Guardian<br />[of Marketing] |
| Head of Operation | Operation | Guardian<br />[Operation] |
| Technical Leader | Mentoring and Architecture | Guardian<br />[of Mentoring and Architecture] |
| Developer | Development | Guardian<br />[Development] |
